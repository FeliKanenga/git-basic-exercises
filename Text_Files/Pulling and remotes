1. You should still be inside the git-basic-exercises directory. Let’s get out of there. cd ../

/*
recruit@umuzi-admin:~/git-basic-exercises$ cd ..
*/

2. Now let’s clone a repo. point your browser here: https://github.com/Umuzi-org/tech-department

3.Now there is a friendly green button that says “Clone or download”. Click on it.
/*
https://github.com/Umuzi-org/tech-department.git
*/

4.You will see a url come up. Copy it. You will need to paste it into the terminal in a moment

/*
https://github.com/Umuzi-org/tech-department.git
*/

5. In your terminal type in git clone $THE_URL_YOU_JUST_COPIED. It should look something like this: git clone https://github.com/Umuzi-org/tech-department

/*
recruit@umuzi-admin:~$ git clone https://github.com/Umuzi-org/tech-department.git
Cloning into 'tech-department'...
*/

6. cd into the tech-department directory that was just created

/*
recruit@umuzi-admin:~$ cd tech-department
recruit@umuzi-admin:~/tech-department$ 
*/

7.explore a little using git branch and git log

/*
recruit@umuzi-admin:~/tech-department$ git branch
* master
recruit@umuzi-admin:~/tech-department$ git log
commit 412b21975971a2a134306d0b58c432d8f1059095 (HEAD -> master, origin/master, origin/HEAD)
Author: Sheena O'Connell <sheena.oconnell@gmail.com>
*/

8. type in git branch -a. This shows the remote branches

/*
recruit@umuzi-admin:~/tech-department$ git branch -a
* master
  remotes/origin/Animals2
  remotes/origin/Big_O
  remotes/origin/HEAD -> origin/master
  remotes/origin/LinuxChallengeUpdate
*/

9.try to checkout the branch called project/git-basic-exercises on your local computer. You can do it, you’ll need to figure out how

/*
recruit@umuzi-admin:~/tech-department$ git checkout -b project/git-basic-exercises
Switched to a new branch 'project/git-basic-exercises'
*/

10. type in git remote -v

/*
recruit@umuzi-admin:~/tech-department$ git remote -v
origin	https://github.com/Umuzi-org/tech-department.git (fetch)
origin	https://github.com/Umuzi-org/tech-department.git (push)
